# DaneBrainUI (Deprecated)

DaneBrainUI was a custom user interface addon for World of Warcraft, designed to declutter and enhance the visual gaming experience. Although this project is no longer active or maintained, this README serves as an archive for its features and utility.

## Features

- **Hotkey & Macro Name Concealment**: DaneBrainUI allowed players to hide unnecessary hotkey texts and macro names to reduce on-screen clutter.

- **Bag & Micro Menu Hiding**: With a focus on minimalism, the addon provided the option to hide bags and the micro menu, which could be toggled to display as needed.

- **Enhanced Textures**: The addon introduced refined textures for a more visually appealing UI without compromising the game's original aesthetic.

- **Customizable Interface**: Users had the freedom to adjust UI elements to fit their personal preference, ensuring a unique and personalized gaming experience.

- **User-friendly**: DaneBrainUI was built with simplicity in mind, making it easy for players to adopt and integrate into their gameplay.

## Deprecation Notice

As of 2023, DaneBrainUI is no longer in development, and support has ceased. The addon may not function with current or future updates of World of Warcraft. Users are advised to consider alternative solutions or revert to the game's default UI.

## Legacy Support
